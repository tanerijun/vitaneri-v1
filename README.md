TODO:

1. implement background particle
2. make it go in 1 direction
3. put an easter egg: if the visitor stay long enough, the particle will start to change direction and accelerate, the speed increase the longer the visitor stay
4. maybe try to find a way to check how long a user has been staying on the page, and make a pop out telling them that they've stay long enough to agitate the particles, something like that
