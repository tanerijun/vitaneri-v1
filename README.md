## Vitaneri V1

This is my first attempt at making a portfolio website. I tried to make it as original as I can, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I love just staring at the background, and enjoy the aesthetic of the site. I especially enjoy the moment when the color balls go behind the name card showing a glassmorphism effect.

The website is live [here](https://vitaneri.vercel.app).

### Tech Stack

I used the amazing technologies below to create this site:

- TypeScript
- NextJS
- React
- ChakraUI
- Framer Motion

### Projects Tab

It's intentionally left empty for now. I plan to fill it with my top 3 best projects when I'm about to apply for jobs.
